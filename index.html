    <h1 class="titel2"> of 17.1 percent </h1>
    <h3 class="main-text">
        Inflation in the Netherlands rose to 17.1 percent in September. <br>
        This is reported by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) on <br> the basis of the European harmonized 
        consumer price index <br> (HICP). According to Statistics Netherlands, this is in any case <br> the highest 
        inflation since the Second World War. In August it <br> was still 13.7 percent, which was also a record.
        The increased <br> energy prices are an important cause: compared to September last <br> year, energy prices 
        including fuel have increased by 114 percent <br> this month. Statistics Netherlands includes the prices 
        of new <br> energy contracts when calculating inflation. For many people, <br> energy inflation will have been 
        lower, for example because they <br> still have a permanent contract. And many people with a variable <br> contract 
        did not experience such a large price increase in <br> September.
